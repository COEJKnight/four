                <p>Welcome to the DATA Act Broker â€“ Alpha Release. This release is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Product</a> and represents just enough functionality so that we can gather critical user feedback to determine the direction and implementation of future features. This version of the Broker aligns with <a href={this.state.rssUrl} target="_blank">Reporting Submission Specification (RSS v1.0)</a>.</p>

                <h2>What's New in This Release</h2>
        
                <p>In this version of the broker, we have made a change if you are logging in with Internet Explorer, added funtionality for the Broker to recognize files with the pipe symbol as a delimiter, and updated some of the validations.

                <h4 name="brokerIE">Logging into the Broker with Internet Explorer</h4>
                <p>During user testing, some Internet Explorer users were unable to log into the Broker and upload files. We implemented a workaround so users with Internet Explorer on <b>medium security settings</b> can log in and upload files. See Known Issues below.</p>

                <h4 name="pipe">Submit File with Pipe Symbol</h4>
                <p>Based on user feedback, we changed the Broker to automatically detect whether a file is using a comma or pipe symbol as a delimiter, based on the format of the header row.</p>

                <h4 name="fileValv1">File Validations per RSS v1.0</h4>
                <p>Submitted files will be validated per RSS v1.0. Specifically:
                <ul>
                <li>Field names match the RSS v1.0
                </li>
                <li>Maximum field length does not exceed the value in RSS v1.0
                </li>
                <li>Required fields are present per RSS v1.0
                </li>
                <li>Records in File C have a PIID, FAIN, or URI
                </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h4 name="crossFileValv1">Cross File Validations</h4>
                <p>We started work on cross file validations, beginning with cross validation of the FAIN, URI or PIID between sample files for Files C and D2.</p>

                <h4 name="browser">Browser Requirements &amp; Known Issues</h4>

                <p>The Broker is currently tested with the following browsers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Internet Explorer version 10 and higher</li>
                    <li>Firefox (current version)</li>
                    <li>Chrome (current version)</li>
                    <li>Safari (current version)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Although you may use any browser/version combination you wish, we cannot support browsers and versions other than the ones stated above.</p>
                <p>Known Issues
                <ul>
                <li>The Broker will not work when using Internet Explorer under medium pricavy settings or high security settings.
                </li>
                </ul>
