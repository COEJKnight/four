#### February 13, 2017
On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contained everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. Now we are making improvements to the Broker and responding to issues discovered through continued agency use.

In this release of the Broker, bugs were fixed relating to downloading cross file warning/error reports, the B14/B15 validations, and Program Activities with the code '0000' and title 'Unknown/Other'. Functionality improvements were rolled out, including downloading submission files, padding zero values for Object Class and Program Activity, and others.

##### B14/B15 validation fix{section=b14}

In earlier versions of the Broker, the B14/B15 validations produced fatal errors. In this release, the B14/B15 validation was changed to a warning.

##### Program Activity{section=pa}

In this release of the Broker, Program Activities with the code '0000' and title 'Unknown/Other' will validate without warnings.

##### Cross file warning/error reports{section=cross}

We discovered a bug in the process for downloading cross file warning and error reports. This has been fixed and users should no longer experience issues when downloading the cross file warning and error reports.

##### Functionality Improvements{section=improvements}

  * File names on the submission page are now links that can download the most recent file uploaded.
  * Object Class and Program activity pass for zero values that are not fully padded to '000' or '0000', respectively.

##### Accessibility Statement{section=accessibilityStatement}

###### Commitment and Guidelines

The DATA Act implementation team is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. To meet this commitment we develop this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). These guidelines explain how to make websites more accessible to people with disabilities, and we believe they also make our website easier for everyone to use.
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) addresses accessibility challenges by defining new ways to provide functionality with assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers are able to provide usable and accessible advanced Web applications to people with disabilities. Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov also uses The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®) to document adherence with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility standards.

We know our website changes regularly so we’re always looking for ways to improve.
