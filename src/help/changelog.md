##### Accessibility Statement{section=accessibilityStatement}

###### Commitment and Guidelines

The DATA Act implementation team is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. To meet this commitment we develop this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). These guidelines explain how to make websites more accessible to people with disabilities, and we believe they also make our website easier for everyone to use.
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) addresses accessibility challenges by defining new ways to provide functionality with assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers are able to provide usable and accessible advanced Web applications to people with disabilities. Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov also uses The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®) to document adherence with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility standards.

We know our website changes regularly so we’re always looking for ways to improve. If there is information you think should be included on this page, or if you experience any difficulty accessing this site, please contact us at [DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov](mailto:DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov) for assistance.

###### Documents

The documents offered within Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov use multiple file formats. Below is a list that will help you identify which software downloads are needed to view different file extensions. If you require a file format other than those currently provided or experience accessibility issues, please contact us at [DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov] (mailto:DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov) for assistance.
