#### April 26, 2017

On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contains everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. We continue to make improvements to the Broker and respond to issues discovered through agency use.

In this release of the Broker, we rolled out functionality improvements for users to navigate to previously completed steps and a disabled certify button for users without certification permissions. We also added a link to the USAspending Service Desk on the Help page.
