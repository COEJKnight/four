On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contains everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. We continue to make improvements to the Broker and respond to issues discovered through agency use.

In this release of the Broker, we added a certified data column to the submission dashboard, updated the warning/error reports to include the rule label, and updated the help page with information about the Service Desk.

  - [Certified date column in the submission dashboard](#/help?section=certifieddatecolumn)
  - [Rule label included in error and warning descriptions](#/help?section=rulelabeldesc)
  - [Service Desk information on help page](#/help?section=servicedeskinfo)

##### Certified date column in the submission dashboard{section=certifieddatecolumn}
In this release, we updated the submission dashboard so that users can see when the file was certified.
