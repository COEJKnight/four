In this release of the Broker, we made the following updates:

 - Updated A33 so that it does not prompt warnings if financing accounts are not included in File A.
 - Updated rule C5 functionality so that it works similarly to B5.
 - Updated the functionality of C8, C11, and C23 so that they apply when ATA is the same as the AID (previously these rules were ignored whenever ATA was filled in, including when ATA was the same as the AID).
 - Corrected C9 so that it does not prompt warnings for awards with negative OriginalLoanSubsidyCost.
 - Note: FABS changes due to DAIMS v1.2 implementation will go live on May 18.
